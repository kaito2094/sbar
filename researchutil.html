    <h1>Research Utilization</h1>

    <p>The findings of this study led to the development of a digital SBAR dashboard designed to improve communication among nurses in hospital settings. Based on the proven benefits of the SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) framework in enhancing clarity, consistency, and safety in patient handovers, the dashboard was created to support staff nurses in selected hospitals in Batangas Province.</p>

    <p>The SBAR dashboard allows nurses to select their hospital and department, log their shift, and systematically document patient information using the SBAR format. It also includes features such as a digital signature for accountability and a shift summary pane to consolidate patient updates. This tool aims to support real-time documentation, reduce communication errors, and promote continuity of care.</p>

    <p>The prototype is designed to be user-friendly and accessible via web browsers, making it a practical solution for immediate clinical implementation. The dashboard can be integrated into existing hospital workflows to reinforce evidence-based nursing practice and improve interprofessional collaboration.</p>

    <p>As part of the research utilization process, the proposed dashboard will be presented to hospital administrators and nursing management in the study sites for potential pilot testing and feedback. Recommendations for future improvement and full system integration will be guided by nurse end-user evaluations and actual workflow observations.</p>
